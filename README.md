**🐍 Python Data Analysis Project**

This repository contains a Python-based data analysis project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and insights extraction using Python libraries.

**📁 Project Files**

File	Description

python project.ipynb	Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code, analysis, and visualizations.

**🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used**

The notebook uses the following Python libraries:

NumPy – numerical computations

Pandas – data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

(Add any others used in your notebook)

**📊 Project Overview**

This project includes:

Importing and inspecting dataset

Checking for missing values

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations to understand patterns in the data

Example operations performed in the notebook:

import numpy as np  # Numerical calculations on the data

df.isnull().sum()   # Checking missing values


(You can add more detailed steps if you want.)
